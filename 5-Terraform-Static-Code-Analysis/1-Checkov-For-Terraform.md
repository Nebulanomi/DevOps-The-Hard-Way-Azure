- [ ] **Run static code analysis** on your Terraform configurations
- [ ] **Interpret scan results** and understand security findings
- [ ] **Implement security fixes** based on Checkov recommendations
- [ ] **Integrate security scanning** into your development workflow

## 📋 **Prerequisites**

**✅ Required Knowledge:**
- [ ] Basic understanding of Terraform syntax and structure
- [ ] Familiarity with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts
- [ ] Basic Python package management (pip)

**🔧 Required Tools:**
- [ ] Python 3.6+ installed
- [ ] pip or pip3 package manager
- [ ] Terminal/command line access
- [ ] Terraform configurations to scan
- [ ] Completed: Previous Terraform tutorials with infrastructure code

**🏗️ Infrastructure Dependencies:**
- [ ] Terraform configurations from previous tutorials
- [ ] Access to terminal for command execution

## 🚀 **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **Step 1: Install Checkov** ⏱️ *5 minutes*

1. **🐍 Verify Python Installation**
   ```bash
   # Check Python version (3.6+ required)
   python3 --version
   # or
   python --version
   ```
   **✅ Expected:** Python 3.6.0 or higher

2. **📦 Install Checkov Package**
   ```bash
   # Install latest compatible version
   pip3 install checkov==3.2.4
   ```

    OR
    
    ```bash
    pip3 install checkov==3.2.4
    ```

2. **Run Checkov**
    Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    checkov
    ```
    You'll see a prompt to set up the free Bridgecrew UI. Press `Y` to start the process.

3. **Scan Terraform Code**

    Run the following command to scan the Terraform code:
    ```bash
    checkov --directory <path_to_terraform_code>
    ```

    For example:
    ```bash
    checkov --directory DevOps-The-Hard-Way-Azure/Terraform-AZURE-Services-Creation/1-acr
    ```

## 🔍 Verification

To ensure Checkov is working correctly:
1. Check that the scan completes without errors
2. Review the list of passed and failed tests in the terminal output
3. Verify that you can access the results in the Bridgecrew UI

## 🧠 Knowledge Check

After running Checkov, consider these questions:
1. What types of issues does Checkov identify in Terraform code?
2. How does Checkov differ from other Terraform validation tools?
3. What are the benefits of using the Bridgecrew UI alongside Checkov?

## 💡 Pro Tip

Use Checkov's `--compact flag` to get a more concise output, or `--quiet` to only see failed checks. This can be helpful when integrating with CI/CD pipelines.
