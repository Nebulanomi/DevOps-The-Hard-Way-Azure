Set up kubectl aliases for common commands (k for kubectl)
Consider kubectx/kubens tools for easier context switching
Always verify your current context before making changes

Use kubectl explain to understand resource specifications
Implement horizontal pod autoscaling for production workloads
Consider Helm charts for complex application packaging
Set up monitoring and alerting for deployed applications

Use Kubernetes namespaces to organise and isolate your resources, especially when deploying multiple applications or environments in the same cluster.
